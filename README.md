EasyCode is a visual programming tool developed in Java and designed to allow students in technical high school courses to learn programming logic through blocks, while they see the matching **C code** being generated right in front of their eyes. 

The tool also supports **Arduino** programming with blocks, using the [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) to deploy and and the **C/Wiring** generated code into the microcontroller.
