EasyCode is a visual programming tool developed in Java and designed to allow students in high school to learn programming logic through blocks, while they see the **C code** being written in front of their own eyes. 
The tool also supports **Arduino** programming with blocks, using the [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) to run and deploy the **C/Wiring** generated code to the microcontroller.
